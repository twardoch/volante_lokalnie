### Changes Made
- Fixed dynamic binding error in MainScreen TUI by removing the _update_bindings() method and its calls.
  Instead, key events are now handled in an on_key override to dynamically manage actions based on whether an offer is selected.

### Next Steps
- Test TUI interactions thoroughly to ensure all key bindings work as expected.
- Monitor user feedback for any further TUI issues or improvements.
